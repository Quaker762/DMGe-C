# DMGe-C
A GameBoy Emulator. Based on Original DMGe (but in C!)

# Progress
Currently (semi)boots the original GameBoy DMG BIOS, however it hangs because Nintendo are great programmers and check if your device is cooked before letting the system continue (i.e, part of our emulated hardware is cooked..)!


# Toolchain
I'm currently using gcc along with gdb as the debugger, so for max compatability, download the latest versions of Code::Blocks and load the project.
